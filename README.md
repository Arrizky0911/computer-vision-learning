**Computer Vision Learning**

This repository consists of my work in implementing machine learning model to solve computer vision problems using open source dataset.

## Respiratory Diseases Multiclass Image Classification 

Image classification is the core problem in computer vision. A common approach for image classification is using neural network model. In [Respiratory_Diseases_Multiclass_Image_Classification](https://github.com/Arrizky0911/computer-vision-learning/Respiratory_Diseases_Multiclass_Image_Classification,ipynb), I implemented different neural network architectures in multiclass images. The dataset can be found on [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset)
