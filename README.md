This repository consists of my work in implementing machine learning model to solve computer vision problems using open source dataset.

## Vehicles Image Classification 

Image classification is the core problem in computer vision. A common approach for image classification is using neural network model. In [Rock-Scissor-Paper Image Classification Using Neural Network](https://), I implemented different neural network architectures in multiclass images, which are rock, scissor, and paper, to predict a single label for a given image. The dataset can be found on [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lyensoetanto/vehicle-images-dataset)
